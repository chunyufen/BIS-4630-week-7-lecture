# Criminal offence (1)

&gt; “On May 11, 2011, a jury found Raj Rajaratnam, chief of the Galleon Group hedge fund, guilty of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in an elaborate insider trading scheme. On October 13, 2011, Judge Richard Holwell of the Southern District of New York sentenced Rajaratnam to eleven years in prison, the longest sentence ever imposed for insider trading. Judge Holwell also fined Rajaratnam $10 million and ordered him to forfeit $53.8 million in profits.”

---

# Criminal offence (2)

&gt; “In a related civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Rajaratnam was ordered to pay an additional $92.8 million in civil penalties and was permanently enjoined from violating securities laws.”

---

# Allegations and investigation

&gt; “Rajaratnam’s conviction was based on several different instances of insider trading in the 2000s. 6 Prosecutors built their case against Rajaratnam during a thirty-two month investigation featuring wiretaps and cooperating witnesses, the first time the government used wiretaps to record phone calls in an insider trading case.”

# Allegation (1)

&gt; “McQuoid (the appellant) was convicted of insider dealing. The appellant was a solicitor and general counsel to a company. In the course of his employment he became a party to inside information about a proposed takeover by another company. He passed the information on to his father-in-law and through his father-in-law procured the purchase of 154,000 shares at 13p per share, paying a total of 20,310. . . .” (to be continued)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Allegation (2)

&gt; “. . . The following day the takeover was made public with an offer price of 45p per share, with the result that a profit was made on the shares of £48,919. The appellant’s father-in-law subsequently gave him a cheque for precisely half of the amount of the profit. Sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment with a confiscation order in the sum of £35,000 and ordered to pay £30,000 towards the cost of the prosecution.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

---

# Allegation (3)

&gt; “insider dealing had been an offence in England and Wales since 1980. Those who involved themselves in insider dealing were criminals, no more and no less. The principles of confidentiality and trust, which were essential to the operation of the commercial world, were betrayed by insider dealing and public confidence in the integrity of the system which was essential to its proper function was undermined by market abuse. Takeover arrangements were normally kept secret. Very few people were permitted to have advance knowledge of them. . . .” (to be continued)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; [FSA press release](http://bit.ly/2hoO6AL)
]


---

# Allegation (4)

&gt; “. . . Those who were entrusted with advance knowledge were entrusted with that knowledge precisely because it was believed that they could be trusted. When they sought to make a profit out of the knowledge and trust reposed in them, their criminality was not reduced or diminished merely because they were individuals of good character. In the present case, the appellant made a substantial profit for himself and for his father-in-law. That demonstrated that profits from even a single transaction of insider dealing could be very high. The court would emphasise that this conduct did not merely contravene regulatory mechanisms. . . .” (to be continued)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

---

# Allegation (5)

&gt; “. . . If there was a feeling that insider dealing was a matter to be covered by regulation, that impression should be rapidly dissipated. The message must be clear. When it was done deliberately, insider dealing was a species of fraud; it was cheating. Prosecution in open and public court would often be appropriate. All those who perpetrated the offence might hope if caught to escape with regulatory proceedings, but they could have no legitimate expectation of avoiding prosecution and sentence. This was not new. In Spearman (2003) EWCA Crim 2893 the court had referred to the need for custodial sentences and an element of deterrence in sentencing for insider trading.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# (3) Neel and Matthew Uberoi: Summary

* Second insider dealing case

* (Neel) Father and (Matthew) son

* Neel: two years imprisonment in November 2009

* Matthew to one year imprisonment in November 2009

# Allegation (1)

&gt; In the second insider dealing case brought by the FSA, former corporate broker intern, Matthew Uberoi and his father, Neel Uberoi, were found guilty of 12 counts of insider dealing after making £110,000 profit.

&gt; “During the summer of 2006 Matthew Uberoi was an intern at a corporate broking firm working on takeovers and other price sensitive deals. He passed inside information to his father in relation to deals in three companies. His father then purchased shares in those companies and made substantial profits.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&gt; “Neel Uberoi, 62, made nearly £110,000 from three forbidden stock market deals, in which he bought shares in companies just before favourable announcements were made to the market. At the time, his son Matthew, 24, was undertaking a six-month placement scheme with Hoare Govett, the brokers of Dutch bank ABN Amro, who were advising on the deals being announced.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&gt; “Neel Uberoi, who worked as a dentist in the NHS for some 35 years before moving into private practice, bought 18,000 shares worth just over £90,000 in a small pharmaceutical company called Neutec Pharma.”

&gt; “On June 6 that year, Neutec announced it was to be taken over by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, and the dentist promptly sold his stake for close to £200,000. Matthew Uberoi’s team at Hoare Govett were advising Neutec.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&gt; “Two weeks later, Neel Uberoi bought 50,000 shares in a small civil engineering company called Birse Group PLC. The firm was in talks about a takeover with Balfour Beattie – who were being advised on the deal by Matthew Uberoi’s team. When the takeover was formally announced, Neel Uberoi sold the shares, making £1,000.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

On August 4, 2006, GKP announced a major contract to explore for oil and gas in Algeria. Neel Uberoi sold his shares in the business for £67,991 – a profit of £8,982.

# (4) Malcolm Calvert: Summary

* Third insider dealing case

* ex-Cazenove trader

* 21 months imprisonment in March 2010

---

# Allegation (1)

&gt; “A former top executive at one of the City’s most prestigious banks faces jail after being found guilty of insider dealing. Malcolm Calvert, who was a partner at the blue-blooded Cazenove – the Queen’s stockbroker – used an unknown insider to get information about a number of proposed mergers and takeovers between 2003 and 2005. He then passed the details to a friend, Bertie Hatcher, who bought shares in three companies: pharmaceutical group Vernalis, road-building business Johnston group, and water company South Staffordshire. The two men split the £103,000 profit from the illegal deals, with Calvert getting two-thirds of the cash.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

---

# Allegation (2)

&gt; “The prosecution is also notable for the involvement of a key witness, Bertie Hatcher - a friend of Calvert - who agreed to provide evidence in the trial having been involved in the illicit dealings himself.”

&gt; “The FSA also announced today that it has fined Hatcher, a retired bookmaker and insurance broker from Ipswich, £56,098 for market abuse, and published details of the agreement it made with him which led to his assistance in the prosecution of Calvert.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

---

# Allegation (3)

&gt; “The FSA found that between 2003 and 2005 Hatcher had profited from inside information, using it to buy and sell about 420,000 shares in six companies. The fine represents the full disgorgement of his share of the net profit from these trades.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&gt; “As part of a settlement with the FSA, Hatcher agreed to provide ongoing assistance to the investigation. In return, the FSA agreed to sanction Hatcher using its regulatory powers rather than a criminal prosecution; Hatcher’s fine was also reduced substantially owing to his cooperation.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Allegation (1)

&gt; “Between January 2005 and December 2010, the Global Markets Division at Deutsche Bank, both in London and abroad, had a culture of generating profits without proper regard to the integrity of the market. For more than five years, trading desks at Deutsche Bank manipulated interbank offered rate (IBOR) submissions across all major currencies. This misconduct involved at least 29 Deutsche Bank individuals, primarily based in London, but also in Frankfurt, Tokyo and New York. It went undetected because of Deutsche Bank’s inadequate systems and controls. Deutsche Bank did not have any systems and controls specific to IBOR and did not put them in place even after being put on notice that there was a risk of misconduct.”

---

# Allegation (2)

&gt; “Deutsche Bank’s failings were compounded by misconduct in its dealings with the FCA. Deutsche Bank gave (FCA) misleading information and provided the FCA with a false attestation that stated that its systems and controls in relation to LIBOR were adequate. This was despite the complete lack of IBOR systems and controls.”

&gt; “Deutsche Bank’s failure to deal with (FCA) in an open and cooperative manner undermined the regulatory regime. The significance of this misconduct was recognised by a 100m fine in that respect alone, which contributed to the record size of the overall 226.8m penalty imposed on Deutsche Bank: the largest penalty (FCA) have ever imposed for LIBOR and EURIBOR-related misconduct.”

  + Paul Coyle

  + Julian Rifat

  + Pardip Saini

---

# Paul Coyle

&gt; “In March 2015, Paul Coyle, the former Group Treasurer and Head of Tax at Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc, pleaded guilty to two counts of insider dealing in connection with price-sensitive information relating to Morrison’s proposed joint venture with Ocado Group Plc. Between 12 February and 17 May 2013, Mr Coyle traded in Ocado shares using his partner’s online trading account and made profits in excess of £79,000. Mr Coyle was subsequently sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay £15,000 towards the cost of his prosecution, in addition to being made subject to a confiscation order for over £203,000. In a clear message to other individuals who might be tempted to engage in insider trading, the sentencing judge concluded that conduct of this nature represented such a serious breach of trust that it demanded an immediate custodial sentence.”

---

# Julian Rifat

&gt; “In March 2015, Julian Rifat, a former senior trader at Moore European Capital Management LLC, was sentenced to a total of 19 months’ imprisonment, having previously pleaded guilty in November 2014 to eight counts of insider dealing in connection with a scheme operated with two associates, Paul Milsom and Graeme Shelley. Mr Rifat had provided price-sensitive information obtained during the course of his employment to Mr Shelley, who then placed trades on the group’s behalf and divided the profits. In sentencing, the judge noted that Mr Rifat’s conduct had been deliberate and dishonest, but gave him credit for his guilty plea and for particular mitigating personal circumstances. In addition to the custodial sentence, Mr Rifat was also fined £100,000 and ordered to pay costs of £159,402.”

---

# Pardip Saini

&gt; “In April 2015, Pardip Saini was sentenced to 528 days’ imprisonment for failure to comply with a confiscation order made against him in September 2014 in connection with insider dealing facilitated by a print room manager at JP Morgan Cazenove, Ersin Mustafa, passing him inside information on potential takeover bids. Mr Saini had been required to pay over £464,000 under the confiscation order, but at the time of his return to court in April 2015, over £222,000 remained unpaid with interest continuing to accrue on the outstanding amount. Alongside the prison sentence (which was in addition to Mr Saini’s original sentence of three years and six months’ imprisonment for the insider dealing itself), Mr Saini’s assets continued to remain subject to a restraint order until satisfaction of the confiscation order.”

* Merrill Lynch International

* Bank of Beirut (UK) Limited

---

# MLI (1)

* Merrill Lynch International (“MLI”)

* Breach of certain provisions in the FCA’s Supervision manual (“SUP”)

&gt; “The FCA’s SUP rules require firms which execute transactions to report details of those transactions to the FCA to facilitate the regulator’s monitoring of market conduct. The specific information that must be provided in each report is set out in SUP and supplemented by guidance in the FCA’s Transaction Reporting User Pack and in certain editions of the FCA’s Market Watch publication.”

&gt; “MLI was subject to a £13,285,900 penalty (reduced by 30 per cent from £18,979,876 for early settlement) for breach of certain provisions in the FCA’s SUP in relation to its submission of transaction reports”

---

# MLI (2)

&gt; “In 2002, MLI had received a private warning from the FSA for failing to report 300,000 transactions as required under SUP and in 2006 the firm was fined £150,000 for submitting inaccurate reports in relation to 1,200,000 transactions. As a result, MLI should have been aware of the importance that the regulator attached to accurate transaction reporting and of the need to monitor its systems and controls to ensure compliance with the SUP requirements.”

---

# MLI (3)

&gt; “Between November 2007 and November 2014, MLI nonetheless continued to make a significant number of errors in relation to transaction reports, resulting in the inaccurate reporting of over 35 million transactions and the failure to report over £121,000 transactions entirely. These errors included:”

---

# MLI (4)

* These errors included:

  + inaccurate reporting of agency transactions by incorrectly reporting both the client and the counter party to the transaction as the central counter party for certain trades

  + inaccurate reporting of the time that certain trades occurred

  + incorrect use of the Buy/Sell indicator in reports to identify the type of transaction that had occurred

  + incorrect mapping of exchange member identifier codes, resulting in incorrect

---

# MLI (5)

* These errors included:

  + identification of the counter parties to certain trades

  + failure to include the maturity dates in reports relating to a number of equity swaps

  + incorrect reporting of the BIC code for transactions that occurred on the Warsaw Stock Exchange; and

  + incorrect identification of counter parties for transactions that occurred on certain US and Russian stock exchanges

  + incorrect identification of counter parties where transactions were routed to MLI’s Spanish and Brazilian affiliates
---

# MLI (6)

&gt; “MLI had been warned about certain of the above failures by the FSA, and subsequently the FCA, both of which had contacted MLI on a number of occasions to express concerns about errors in its transaction reports.”

&gt; “The FCA concluded that MLI’s failures had been particularly serious because they had the potential to interfere with its ability to detect market abuse and the regulator had made clear to MLI numerous times over an extended period that improvements in its transaction reporting systems and controls were needed.”

# BoB (1)

* Bank of Beirut (UK) Ltd (“BoB”)

&gt; “BoB was subject to a £2,100,000 penalty and a 126-day restriction on acquiring any new customers that were resident or incorporated in high-risk jurisdictions, as a result of its failure to comply with Principle 11 (cooperation with the regulator) of the FCA’s Principles for Businesses in connection with its anti-money laundering (“AML”) systems and controls. The penalties were reduced by 30 per cent from a financial penalty of £3,000,000 and a 180-day restriction, due to early settlement.”

---

# BoB (2)

&gt; “BoB is a UK subsidiary of a Lebanese bank which, during the relevant period between June 2011 and March 2013, primarily dealt with clients from jurisdictions that were typically considered as higher risk from an AML perspective.”

---

# BoB (3)

&gt; “In December 2010, the FSA had conducted a risk assessment of BoB which identified a number of concerns relating to the bank’s governance and internal audit function, including its lack of a compliance monitoring programme. This resulted in the FSA providing a remediation plan to BoB in March 2011 which was designed to address the outstanding issues and reduce the risk that the bank’s business might be used to further financial crime. In particular, the remediation plan contained three key action points:”

---

# BoB (4)

* Three key action points:

  + by June 2011, BoB was to have resolved all outstanding issues relating to its internal audit and was to notify the FSA of the relevant actions taken

  + by September 2011, BoB was to have developed an adequate compliance monitoring programme; and

  + by June 2012, BoB was to have reviewed the implementation of all other steps required by the remediation plan to ensure that these had been properly embedded in the bank’s systems and controls.

---

# BoB (5)

&gt; “In April and May 2011, the FSA visited BoB again to assess the adequacy of its AML systems and controls, identifying a number of weaknesses in its customer due diligence process. Amongst other failures, BoB did not carry out enhanced due diligence when establishing relationships with customers who presented a higher risk of money laundering, and failed to conduct adequate ongoing monitoring of those relationships, as required under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. In particular, the FSA noted that BoB had failed to:”

---

# BoB (6)

* BoB had failed to:

  + carry out or document proper risk assessments in relation to higher risk customers

  + obtain or document senior management approval for the establishment of customer relationships with politically exposed persons

---

# BoB (7)

&gt; “The FSA noted that BoB did not conduct compliance monitoring in relation to financial crime and again reiterated that a compliance monitoring programme needed to be instituted as a top priority. BoB confirmed to the FSA that it would implement the required improvements.”

---

# BoB (8)

&gt; “In June 2012, the FSA repeatedly contacted BoB to verify that the remediation plan had been fully implemented. BoB replied that it had not carried out a review of the implementation of the remediation plan, but that the action points themselves had been implemented, which was an inaccurate representation of the position. The FSA subsequently asked BoB to provide a report on how the relevant requirements had been implemented by the end of July 2012. The report that BoB submitted gave assurances that the bank’s Compliance department had implemented a more sophisticated compliance monitoring programme from the beginning of July, when in fact no implementation steps had yet been taken. A further misleading report was submitted to the FSA in August 2012, again confirming that the remediation plan had been embedded within BoB’s systems and controls.”

---

# BoB (9)

&gt; “In mid-August 2012, the FSA indicated that it did not consider that BoB had implemented the remediation plan as required, but granted an extension until 1 September 2012 for all action points to be completed. At the end of November 2012, BoB submitted another report to the regulator, again stating that the remediation plan had been fully actioned and that the compliance monitoring programme was in place and “ongoing”. The original draft of the report had stated that the compliance monitoring programme had not been fully tested, but this statement was removed following a suggestion from a senior manager within BoB.”

---

# BoB (10)

&gt; “In March 2013, the FSA returned to BoB to carry out a further review of its customer AML files and identified that BoB had failed to take the necessary steps to remedy defects in some of the original customer files that it had reviewed in 2011, despite having been requested to do so. Those files which BoB purported to have remedied were still not compliant with the relevant regulatory requirements.”

---

# BoB (11)

&gt; “The FCA subsequently concluded that BoB had failed to be open and cooperative with the FSA by providing a number of false assurances to the regulator in relation to the implementation of the remediation plan and compliance monitoring programme and by failing to disclose that it had not remedied certain defective customer AML files.”
